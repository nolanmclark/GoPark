# GoPark

Find facts and information about any of the US National Parks. This is a great tool to save your favorite parks and view all the visitor information to help you plan your next trip. This project is currently in development. 

Front-end is Angular 4, 0Auth implementation for authentication (although I might make the switch to Firebase Auth), and uses the NPS API for all park data, https://github.com/nationalparkservice. 

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
